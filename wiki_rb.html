      <h3>Birth to Now</h3>
      <p>
        Ruskin Bond was born in Kasauli, India, on May 19, 1934.Ruskin Bond was
        born on May 19, 1934 in Kasauli, India. His father, Aubrey Bond, served
        in the Royal Air Force, and the family moved frequently. Bond was raised
        by his mother and stepfather, and spent most of his childhood in Shimla
        and Dehradun.
      </p>
      <h3>Writing his first Novel</h3>
      <p>
        Ruskin Bond wrote his first novel (The Room on the roof) when he was
        seventeen. He wrote it in 1956 and recived the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize
        in 1957. Rusty was created by Ruskin Bond to write stories about his own
        past. The Book It was a semi-autobiographical story with Rusty being the
        protagonist. It was based on his friends and the time he spent in a
        rented room, when he was in Dehradun.
      </p>
      <h3>Now</h3>
      <p>
        Since 1963 he has lived as a freelance writer in Mussoorie, a town in
        the Himalayan foothills in Uttarakhand where he lives with his adoptive
        family in Landour, Mussoorie's Ivy Cottage, which has been his home
        since 1980. Asked what he likes the most about his life, he said, "That
        I have been able to write for so long. I started at the age of 17 or 18
        and I am still writing. If I were not a professional writer who was
        getting published I would still write." In his essay, "Scenes from a
        Writer's Life", he explains his Indian identity, "Race did not make me
        one. Religion did not make me one. But history did. And in the long run,
        it's history that counts." His sister Ellen lived in Ludhiana with his
        stepsister until she died in 2014. He also has a brother, William, who
        lives in Canada.
      </p>
      <h3>Writing life</h3>
      <p>
        Most of his works are influenced by life in the hill stations at the
        foothills of the Himalayas, where he spent his childhood.The Room on the
        Roof, was written when he was 16 and published when he was 21. It was
        partly based on his experiences at Dehradun, in his small rented room on
        the roof, and his friends. His earlier works were written without it
        being meant for any particular readership. His first children's book,
        Angry River, published in 1972, had its writing toned down on a
        publisher's request for a children's story. On writing for children, he
        said, "I had a pretty lonely childhood and it helps me to understand a
        child better." Bond's work reflects his Anglo-Indian experiences and the
        changing political, social and cultural aspects of India, having been
        through colonial, postcolonial and post-independence phases of India.
        Ruskin Bond said that while his autobiographical work, Rain in the
        Mountains, was about his years spent in Mussoorie, Scenes from a
        Writer's Life described his first 21 years. Scenes from a Writer's Life
        focuses on Bond's trip to England, his struggle to find a publisher for
        his first book The Room on the Roof and his yearning to come back to
        India, particularly to Doon. "It also tells a lot about my parents",
        said Bond. "The book ends with the publication of my first novel and my
        decision to make writing my livelihood", Bond said, adding: "Basically,
        it describes how I became a writer".
      </p>
      <h3>Filmography</h3>
      <p>
        The 1978 Bollywood film Junoon is based on Bond's novel A Flight of
        Pigeons (about an episode during the Indian Rebellion of 1857). It was
        produced by Shashi Kapoor and directed by Shyam Benegal. The Rusty
        stories have been adapted into a Doordarshan TV series Ek Tha Rusty.

        Bhardwaj made a film based on his popular novel for children, The Blue
        Umbrella. The movie won the National Film Award for Best Children's
        Film. Ruskin Bond made his maiden big-screen appearance with ain Vishal

        Seven Husbands. Bond appears as a bishop in the movie with Priyanka
        Chopra playing the title role. Bond had earlier collaborated with
