      <h3>Early age and Carrer</h3>
      <p>
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a
        Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
        Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil
        Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
        local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned a
        ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the
        now uninhabited Dhanushkodi. Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and
        one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar
        traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of
        land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu
        and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The
        family business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and
        the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims
        between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge
        to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family
        fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from the ancestral
        home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a
        young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager
        income. In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described
        as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He
        spent hours on his studies, especially Mathematics. After completing his
        education at Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam
        went on to attend the St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli from where
        he graduated in Physics in 1954. Kalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study
        aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While Kalam was
        working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his
        lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the
        project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline,
        impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under
        stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline." He narrowly missed
        achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in
        qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

      <h3>Presidency</h3>
      <p>
        Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan.
        He won the 2002 presidential election with an electoral vote of 922,884,
        surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from
        25 July 2002, to 25 July 2007. On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic
        Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would
        nominate Kalam for the post of President, and both the Samajwadi Party
        and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the
        Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to
        seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear. Kalam said of
        the announcement of his candidature: I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere
        both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I
        was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at
        this juncture. On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the
        Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet
        colleagues. Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh
        during his presidency The polling for the presidential election began on
        15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with the media
        claiming that the election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory
        was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July. Kalam
        became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy
        victory, and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in
        on 25 July. Kalam was the third President of India to have been
        honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before
        becoming the President Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Husain
        (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the
        President of India. He was also the first scientist and the first
        bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan. During his term as president,
        he was affectionately known as the People's President,
        saying that signing the Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision
        he had taken during his tenure. Kalam was criticised for his
        inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions
        submitted to him during his tenure. Article 72 of the Constitution
        of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend
        or commute the death sentence of convicts on death row. Kalam
        acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year tenure as president,
        rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later
        hanged. Perhaps the most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a
        Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001
        attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the
        Supreme Court of India in 2004. While the sentence was scheduled to
        be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea
        resulted in him remaining on death row. He also took the
        controversial decision to impose President's Rule in Bihar in 2005.
        In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam
        supported the need of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the
        population of the country. At the end of his term, on 20
        June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in
        office provided there was certainty about his victory in the 2007
        presidential election. However, two days later, he decided not to
        contest the Presidential election again stating that he wanted to avoid
        involving Rashtrapati Bhavan from any political processes. He was
        proposed by third front named United National Progressive Alliance
        leader J. Jayalalithaa and coordinator Chandrababu Naidu other leaders
        Mulayam Singh Yadav and Om Prakash Chautala, but he did not have the
        support of the left parties, Shiv Sena and UPA constituents, to receive
        a renewed mandate.
