      <h3>Albert Einstein</h3>
      <p>
        Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely
        held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all
        time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also
        made important contributions to quantum mechanics.

      <h3>Childhood</h3>
      <p>
        Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the
        German Empire, on 14 March 1879. His parents, secular Ashkenazi Jews,
        were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch. In
        1880, the family moved to Munich's borough of
        Ludwigsvorstadt-Isarvorstadt, where Einstein's father and his uncle
        Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie, a company that
        manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current. Albert
        attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich from the age of five.
        When he was eight, he was transferred to the Luitpold Gymnasium, where
        he received advanced primary and then secondary school education. In
        1894, Hermann and Jakob's company tendered for a contract to install
        electric lighting in Munich, but without success—they lacked the capital
        that would have been required to update their technology from direct
        current to the more efficient, alternating current alternative. The
        failure of their bid forced them to sell their Munich factory and search
        for new opportunities elsewhere. The Einstein family moved to Italy,
        first to Milan and a few months later to Pavia, where they settled in
        Palazzo Cornazzani. Einstein, then fifteen, stayed behind in Munich in
        order to finish his schooling. His father wanted him to study electrical
        engineering, but he was a fractious pupil who found the Gymnasium's
        regimen and teaching methods far from congenial. He later wrote that the
        school's policy of strict rote learning was harmful to creativity. At
        the end of December 1894, a letter from a doctor persuaded the
        Luitpold's authorities to release him from its care, and he joined his
        family in Pavia. While in Italy as a teenager, he wrote an essay
        entitled "On the Investigation of the State of the Ether in a Magnetic
        Field".

      <h3>Children and Maragies</h3>
      <p>
        Einstein included just one woman, a twenty year old Serbian, Mileva
        Marić. Over the next few years, the pair spent many hours discussing
        their shared interests and learning about topics in physics that the
        polytechnic school's lectures did not cover. In his letters to Marić,
        Einstein confessed that exploring science with her by his side was much
        more enjoyable than reading a textbook in solitude. Eventually the two
        students became not only friends but also lovers. Historians of physics
        are divided on the question of the extent to which Marić contributed to
        the insights of Einstein's annus mirabilis publications. There is at
        least some evidence that he was influenced by her scientific ideas, but
        there are scholars who doubt whether her impact on his thought was of
        any great significance at all. Correspondence between Einstein and
        Marić, discovered and published in 1987, revealed that in early 1902,
        while Marić was visiting her parents in Novi Sad, she gave birth to a
        daughter, Lieserl. When Marić returned to Switzerland it was without the
        child, whose fate is uncertain. A letter of Einstein's that he wrote in
        September 1903 suggests that the girl was either given up for adoption
        or died of scarlet fever in infancy. Einstein and Marić married in
        January 1903. In May 1904, their son Hans Albert was born in Bern,
        Switzerland. Their son Eduard was born in Zürich in July 1910. In
        letters that Einstein wrote to Marie Winteler in the months before
        Eduard's arrival, he described his love for his wife as "misguided" and
        mourned the "missed life" that he imagined he would have enjoyed if he
        had married Winteler instead: "I think of you in heartfelt love every
        spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be." In 1912, Einstein
        entered into a relationship with Elsa Löwenthal, who was both his first
        cousin on his mother's side and his second cousin on his father's. When
        Marić learned of his infidelity soon after moving to Berlin with him in
        April 1914, she returned to Zürich, taking Hans Albert and Eduard with
        her. Einstein and Marić were granted a divorce on 14 February 1919 on
        the grounds of having lived apart for five years. As part of the divorce
        settlement, Einstein agreed that if he were to win a Nobel Prize, he
        would give the money that he received to Marić; he won the prize two
        years later. Einstein married Löwenthal in 1919. In 1923, he began a
        relationship with a secretary named Betty Neumann, the niece of his
        close friend Hans Mühsam. Löwenthal nevertheless remained loyal to him,
        accompanying him when he emigrated to the United States in 1933. In
        1935, she was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems. She died in
        December 1936.
