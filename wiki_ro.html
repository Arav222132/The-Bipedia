      <h3>Julius Robert Oppenheimer</h3>
      <p>
        J. Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist. He was
        director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World
        War II and is often called the "father of the atomic bomb".

      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>
        Oppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer into a non-observant
        Jewish family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née
        Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful
        textile importer. Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a
        physicist. Their father was born in Hanau, when it was still part of the
        Hesse-Nassau province of the Kingdom of Prussia, and as a teenager made
        his way to the United States in 1888, without money, higher education,
        or even English. He was hired by a textile company and within a decade
        was an executive there, eventually becoming wealthy. In 1912, the family
        moved to an apartment on Riverside Drive near West 88th Street,
        Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses. Their
        art collection included works by Pablo Picasso, Édouard Vuillard, and
        Vincent van Gogh. Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin
        Preparatory School. In 1911, he entered the Ethical Culture Society
        School, founded by Felix Adler to promote training based on the Ethical
        Culture movement, whose motto was "Deed before Creed". Oppenheimer's
        father had been a member of the Society for many years, serving on its
        board of trustees. Oppenheimer was a versatile student, interested in
        English and French literature, and particularly mineralogy. He completed
        third and fourth grades in one year and skipped half of eighth grade. He
        graduated in 1921, but his further education was delayed a year by an
        attack of colitis contracted while prospecting in Joachimstal during a
        family vacation in Czechoslovakia. He recovered in New Mexico, where he
        developed a love for horseback riding and the southwestern United
        States. Oppenheimer entered Harvard College in 1922 at age 18. He
        majored in chemistry; Harvard also required studies in history,
        literature, and philosophy or mathematics. To compensate for the delay
        caused by his illness, he took six courses each term instead of the
        usual four. He was admitted to the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta
        Kappa and was granted graduate standing in physics on the basis of
        independent study, allowing him to bypass basic courses in favor of
        advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on
        thermodynamics taught by Percy Bridgman. Oppenheimer graduated from
        Harvard in 1925 with a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, after only
        three years of study.

      <h3>Manhattan Project</h3>
      <p>
        On October 9, 1941, two months before the United States entered World
        War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a crash program to
        develop an atomic bomb. Ernest Lawrence brought Oppenheimer into the
        Manhattan Project on October 21. Oppenheimer was assigned to take over
        the project's specific bomb-design research by Arthur Compton at the
        Metallurgical Laboratory. On May 18, 1942, National Defense Research
        Committee Chairman James B. Conant, who had been one of Oppenheimer's
        lecturers at Harvard, asked Oppenheimer to take over work on fast
        neutron calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into with full
        vigor. He was given the title "Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"; "rapid
        rupture" is a technical term that refers to the propagation of a fast
        neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to
        host a summer school for atomic bomb theory in Berkeley. The mix of
        European physicists and his own students—a group including Serber, Emil
        Konopinski, Felix Bloch, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller—kept themselves
        busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make
        the bomb. Mug shot with "K-6" over it. Oppenheimer's ID photo from the
        Los Alamos Laboratory In June 1942, the U.S. Army established the
        Manhattan Engineer District to handle its part in the atom bomb project,
        beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the Office of
        Scientific Research and Development to the military. In September,
        Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was appointed director of what
        became known as the Manhattan Project. By October 12, 1942, Groves and
        Oppenheimer had decided that for security and cohesion, they needed to
        establish a centralized, secret research laboratory in a remote
        location. Groves selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret
        weapons laboratory, although it is not known precisely when. This
        decision surprised many, because Oppenheimer had left-wing political
        views and no record as a leader of large projects. Groves worried that
        because Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize, he might not have had
        the prestige to direct fellow scientists, but Groves was impressed by
        Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of the project and
        by the breadth of his knowledge.As a military engineer, Groves knew that
        this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project that would involve
        not just physics but also chemistry, metallurgy, ordnance, and
        engineering. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something that many
        others did not, an "overweening ambition",[128] which Groves reckoned
        would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a successful
        conclusion.[128] Oppenheimer's past associations were not overlooked,
        but on July 20, 1943, Groves directed that he receive a security
        clearance "without delay irrespective of the information which you have
        concerning Mr Oppenheimer. He is absolutely essential to the
        project."[129] Rabi considered Oppenheimer's appointment "a real stroke
        of genius on the part of General Groves, who was not generally
        considered to be a genius".[130] Oppenheimer favored a location for the
        laboratory in New Mexico, not far from his ranch. On November 16, 1942,
        he, Groves and others toured a prospective site. Oppenheimer feared that
        the high cliffs surrounding it would feel claustrophobic, and there was
        concern about possible flooding. He then suggested a site he knew well:
        a flat mesa near Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was the site of a private
        boys' school, the Los Alamos Ranch School. The engineers were concerned
        about the poor access road and the water supply but otherwise felt that
        it was ideal.[131] The Los Alamos Laboratory was built on the site of
        the school, taking over some of its buildings, while many new buildings
        were erected in great haste. At the laboratory, Oppenheimer assembled a
        group of the top physicists of the time, whom he called the
        "luminaries".[132] Los Alamos was initially supposed to be a military
        laboratory, and Oppenheimer and other researchers were to be
        commissioned into the Army. He went so far as to order himself a
        lieutenant colonel's uniform and take the Army physical test, which he
        failed. Army doctors considered him underweight at 128 pounds (58 kg),
        diagnosed his chronic cough as tuberculosis, and were concerned about
        his chronic lumbosacral joint pain.[133] The plan to commission
        scientists fell through when Rabi and Robert Bacher balked at the idea.
        Conant, Groves, and Oppenheimer devised a compromise whereby the
        University of California operated the laboratory under contract to the
        War Department.[134] It soon turned out that Oppenheimer had hugely
        underestimated the magnitude of the project: Los Alamos grew from a few
        hundred people in 1943 to over 6,000 in 1945. As a military engineer,
        Groves knew that this would be vital in an interdisciplinary project
        that would involve not just physics but also chemistry, metallurgy,
        ordnance, and engineering. Groves also detected in Oppenheimer something
        that many others did not, an "overweening ambition",[128] which Groves
        reckoned would supply the drive necessary to push the project to a

      <h3>Relationships and children</h3>
      In 1936, Oppenheimer became involved with Jean Tatlock, the daughter of a
      Berkeley literature professor and a student at Stanford University School
      of Medicine. The two had similar political views; she wrote for the
      Western Worker, a Communist Party newspaper. In 1939, after a
      tempestuous relationship, Tatlock broke up with Oppenheimer. In August of
      that year, he met Katherine ("Kitty") Puening, a radical Berkeley student
      and former Communist Party member. Kitty's first marriage had lasted only
      a few months. Her second, common-law, husband from 1934 to 1937 was Joe
      Dallet, an active member of the Communist Party killed in 1937 in the
      Spanish Civil War. Kitty returned from Europe to the U.S., where she
      obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in botany from the University of
      Pennsylvania. In 1938 she married Richard Harrison, a physician and
      medical researcher, and in June 1939 moved with him to Pasadena,
      California, where he became chief of radiology at a local hospital and she
      enrolled as a graduate student at the University of California, Los
      Angeles. She and Oppenheimer created a minor scandal by sleeping together
      after one of Tolman's parties, and in the summer of 1940 she stayed with
      Oppenheimer at his ranch in New Mexico. When she became pregnant, Kitty
      asked Harrison for a divorce and he agreed to it. On November 1, 1940, she
      obtained a quick divorce in Reno, Nevada, and married Oppenheimer.
      Their first child, Peter, was born in May 1941, and their second,
      Katherine ("Toni"), was born in Los Alamos, New Mexico, on December 7,
      1944. During his marriage, Oppenheimer rekindled his affair with
      Tatlock. Later, their continued contact became an issue in his
      security clearance hearings because of Tatlock's communist
      associations. Throughout the development of the atomic bomb,
      Oppenheimer was under investigation by both the FBI and the Manhattan
      Project's internal security arm for his past left-wing associations. He
      was followed by Army security agents during a trip to California in June
      1943 to visit Tatlock, who was suffering from depression. Oppenheimer
      spent the night in her apartment. Tatlock killed herself on January 4,
      1944, leaving Oppenheimer deeply grieved. At Los Alamos, Oppenheimer
      began an emotional affair with Ruth Tolman, a psychologist and the wife of
      his friend Richard Tolman. The affair ended after Oppenheimer returned
      east to become director of the Institute for Advanced Study but, after
      Richard's death in August 1948, they reconnected and saw each other
      occasionally until Ruth's death in 1957. Few of their letters survive, but
      those that do reflect a close and affectionate relationship, with
      Oppenheimer calling her "My Love".
