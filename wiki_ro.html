      <h3>Julius Robert Oppenheimer</h3>
      <p>
        J. Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist. He was
        director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World
        War II and is often called the "father of the atomic bomb".

      <h3>Early Life</h3>
      <p>
        Oppenheimer was born Julius Robert Oppenheimer into a non-observant
        Jewish family in New York City on April 22, 1904, to Ella (née
        Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer, a successful
        textile importer. Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a
        physicist. Their father was born in Hanau, when it was still part of the
        Hesse-Nassau province of the Kingdom of Prussia, and as a teenager made
        his way to the United States in 1888, without money, higher education,
        or even English. He was hired by a textile company and within a decade
        was an executive there, eventually becoming wealthy. In 1912, the family
        moved to an apartment on Riverside Drive near West 88th Street,
        Manhattan, an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses. Their
        art collection included works by Pablo Picasso, Édouard Vuillard, and
        Vincent van Gogh. Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin
        Preparatory School. In 1911, he entered the Ethical Culture Society
        School, founded by Felix Adler to promote training based on the Ethical
        Culture movement, whose motto was "Deed before Creed". Oppenheimer's
        father had been a member of the Society for many years, serving on its
        board of trustees. Oppenheimer was a versatile student, interested in
        English and French literature, and particularly mineralogy. He completed
        third and fourth grades in one year and skipped half of eighth grade. He
        graduated in 1921, but his further education was delayed a year by an
        attack of colitis contracted while prospecting in Joachimstal during a
        family vacation in Czechoslovakia. He recovered in New Mexico, where he
        developed a love for horseback riding and the southwestern United
        States. Oppenheimer entered Harvard College in 1922 at age 18. He
        majored in chemistry; Harvard also required studies in history,
        literature, and philosophy or mathematics. To compensate for the delay
        caused by his illness, he took six courses each term instead of the
        usual four. He was admitted to the undergraduate honor society Phi Beta
        Kappa and was granted graduate standing in physics on the basis of
        independent study, allowing him to bypass basic courses in favor of
        advanced ones. He was attracted to experimental physics by a course on
        thermodynamics taught by Percy Bridgman. Oppenheimer graduated from
        Harvard in 1925 with a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, after only
        three years of study.

      <h3>Manhattan Project</h3>
      <p>
        On October 9, 1941, two months before the United States entered World
        War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt approved a crash program to
        develop an atomic bomb. Ernest Lawrence brought Oppenheimer into the
        Manhattan Project on October 21. Oppenheimer was assigned to take over
        the project's specific bomb-design research by Arthur Compton at the
        Metallurgical Laboratory. On May 18, 1942, National Defense Research
        Committee Chairman James B. Conant, who had been one of Oppenheimer's
        lecturers at Harvard, asked Oppenheimer to take over work on fast
        neutron calculations, a task Oppenheimer threw himself into with full
        vigor. He was given the title "Coordinator of Rapid Rupture"; "rapid
        rupture" is a technical term that refers to the propagation of a fast
        neutron chain reaction in an atomic bomb. One of his first acts was to
        host a summer school for atomic bomb theory in Berkeley. The mix of
        European physicists and his own students—a group including Serber, Emil
        Konopinski, Felix Bloch, Hans Bethe, and Edward Teller—kept themselves
        busy by calculating what needed to be done, and in what order, to make
        the bomb. Mug shot with "K-6" over it. Oppenheimer's ID photo from the
        Los Alamos Laboratory In June 1942, the U.S. Army established the
        Manhattan Engineer District to handle its part in the atom bomb project,
        beginning the process of transferring responsibility from the Office of
        Scientific Research and Development to the military. In September,
        Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves Jr., was appointed director of what
        became known as the Manhattan Project. By October 12, 1942, Groves and
        Oppenheimer had decided that for security and cohesion, they needed to
        establish a centralized, secret research laboratory in a remote 
        location. Groves selected Oppenheimer to head the project's secret
        weapons laboratory, although it is not known precisely when. This
        decision surprised many, because Oppenheimer had left-wing political
        views and no record as a leader of large projects. Groves worried that
        because Oppenheimer did not have a Nobel Prize, he might not have had
        the prestige to direct fellow scientists, but Groves was impressed by
        Oppenheimer's singular grasp of the practical aspects of the project and
        by the breadth of his knowledge.
