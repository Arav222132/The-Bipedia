    <h3>Mahatma Gandhi</h3>
    <p>
      Mohan Das Karmchand Gandhi was an Indian lawer who employed nonviolent
      resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from
      British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across
      the world. The honorific Mahātmā , first applied to him in South Africa
      in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

    <h3>Journey of his parents</h3>
    <p>Gandhi's father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi (1822–1885), served as the dewan (chief minister)
      of Porbandar state. His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then
      Junagadh State. Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had
      an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister.
      During his tenure, Karamchand married four times. His first two wives died young, after each had
      given birth to a daughter, and his third marriage was childless. In 1857, Karamchand sought his
      third wife's permission to remarry; that yer, he married Putlibai (1844–1891), who also came from
      Junagadh, and was from a Pranami Vaishnava family. Karamchand and Putlibai had four
      children: a son, Laxmidas (c. 1860–1914); a daughter, Raliatbehn (1862–1960); a second son,
      Karsandas (c. 1866–1913).[9][10] and a third son, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who was born
      on 2 October 1869 in Porbandar (also known as Sudamapuri), a coastal town on the Kathiawar
      Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of
      the British Raj.</p>
