      <h3>Alexander Graham Bell</h3>
      <p>
        Alexander Graham Bell is mostly known as the founder of the Telephone.
        He's also one of the co-founders of AT&T (Amarican Telephone and
        Telegraph Company).

      <h3>About Him</h3>
      <p>
        Alex's father,grandfather and brother had took part in Elocution and
        speech. His both mother and wife were deaf. This led to him researching
        more about hearing devices like why he invented the Telephone. This
        eventually led to him being awarded the first ever U.S.Paten for the
        Telephone on March 7 1876. Many other inventions marked Bell's later
        life, including groundbreaking work in optical telecommunications,
        hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Bell also had a strong influence on the
        National Geographic Society and its magazine while serving as the second
        president from January 7, 1898, until 1903.
      </p>
      <h3>Early life</h3>
      <p>
        Bell was born in Edinburgh, on March 3, 1847. The family home was at
        South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as Bell's
        birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845–1870) and
        Edward Charles Bell (1848–1867), both of whom would die of
        tuberculosis.[15] His father was Alexander Melville Bell, a phonetician,
        and his mother was Eliza Grace Bell (née Symonds). Born as just
        "Alexander Bell", at age 10, he made a plea to his father to have a
        middle name like his two brothers. For his 11th birthday, his father
        acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the name "Graham", chosen out of
        respect for Alexander Graham, a Canadian being treated by his father who
        had become a family friend. To close relatives and friends he remained
        "Aleck". Bell and his siblings attended a Presbyterian Church in their
        youth.

      <h3>Experiments with sound</h3>
      <p>
        His father encouraged Bell's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his
        sons to see a unique automaton developed by Sir Charles Wheatstone based
        on the earlier work of Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen. The rudimentary
        "mechanical man" simulated a human voice. Bell was fascinated by the
        machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published
        in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother
        Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested
        in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys
        on with the enticement of a "big prize" if they were successful. While
        his brother constructed the throat and larynx, Bell tackled the more
        difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in
        a remarkably lifelike head that could "speak", albeit only a few words.
        The boys would carefully adjust the "lips" and when a bellows forced air
        through the windpipe, a very recognizable Mama ensued, to the delight of
        neighbours who came to see the Bell invention.

      <h3>A Big Tragdey for Bell</h3>
      <p>
        In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London, Bell returned to Weston
        House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued
        experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment. Bell
        concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later
        installed a telegraph wire from his room in Somerset College to that of
        a friend. Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through
        exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward "Ted", was similarly affected by
        tuberculosis. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in
        correspondence as "A. G. Bell") and served the next year as an
        instructor at Somerset College, Bath, England, his brother's condition
        deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell
        returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved
        out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at University College London,
        Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree
        examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to
        studying. Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and
        lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf
        in South Kensington, London. His first two pupils were deaf-mute girls
        who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother
        seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own
        elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a
        family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died
        from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His
        father had also experienced a debilitating illness earlier in life and
        had been restored to health by a convalescence in Newfoundland. Bell's
        parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their
        remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Alexander Melville
        Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property,[N 6]
        conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student,
        curing a pronounced lisp), and join his father and mother in setting out
        for the "New World". Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a
        relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, as he had surmised, was not
        prepared to leave England with him.
      </p>
      <h3>Making The Telephone</h3>
      <p>
        By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a
        formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston "laboratory"
        (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success.[N
        12] While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a
        "phonautograph", a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound
        waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might
        be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded
        to sound waves. Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to
        different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the
        undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to
        demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas. In 1874, telegraph
        message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of Western Union
        President William Orton, had become "the nervous system of commerce".
        Orton had contracted with inventors Thomas Edison and Elisha Gray to
        find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to
        avoid the great cost of constructing new lines. When Bell mentioned
        to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method
        of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device,
        the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's
        experiments. Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's patent
        attorney, Anthony Pollok. In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the
        scientist Joseph Henry, who was then director of the Smithsonian
        Institution, and asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi-reed
        apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph.
        Henry replied that Bell had "the germ of a great invention". When Bell
        said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, "Get
        it!" That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even
        though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments,
        nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a
        chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and Thomas A. Watson, an experienced
        electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of
        Charles Williams, changed all that.
