        • The first New Year's celebration was around 4,000 years ago in ancient
        Babylon. The Babylonians celebrated a festival called Akitu, which means
        "barley" in Sumerian, on the first new moon after the spring equinox.
        <br />
        • The new year is a perfect time to make a change for the better. The
        tradition of making New Year's resolutions is more common in the western
        hemisphere but also exists in the eastern hemisphere <br />• The first
        time that January 1st was celebrated as the beginning of a new year was
        in 153 B.C. when the Romans moved the first month their calendar back
        to January to coincide with elections of the two highest ranking
        Republic positions.

        • The first time that January 1st was celebrated as the beginning of a
        new year was in 153 B.C. when the Romans moved the first month of their
        calendar back to January to coincide with elections of the two highest
        ranking Republic positions. <br />• The first of January represents the
        fresh start of a new year after a period of remembrance of
        the passing year. <br />
        •In the United States people eat black eye peas, cabbage, and ham on New
        Year's Eve for good luck. <br />
        • The first place to ring in the New Year is Kiritimati Island, which is
        part of the Republic of Kiribati. The small region is also known as
        Christmas Island, which is in the world's farthest forward time zone,
        making it 19 hours ahead of places like NYC. <br />
        • Find a way to include a round food (think donuts, bagels…) into your
        New Year's meal. The shape symbolizes that the year has
        come full circle.
