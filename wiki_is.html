            English used)He was born on Chirsmas 25th of December. His father also had the name Issac
            Newton had died three months before little Issac was born. Born prematurely, Newton was a small

            Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother.Margery Ayscough
            (n√©e Blythe). Newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his
            mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19:
            "Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them."Newton's mother had
            three children (Mary, Benjamin, and Hannah) from her second marriage.
