      <h3>Thomas Alva Edison</h3>
      <p>
        Thomas Alva Edison was an amrican inventor and businessman.He developed
        many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass
        communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions,
        which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early
        versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the
        modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply
        the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of
        invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established
        the first industrial research laboratory

      <h3>About him</h3>
      <p>
        Edison was raised in the American Midwest. Early in his career he worked
        as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions.
        In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New
        Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later
        established a botanical laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in
        collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a
        laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's first
        film studio, the Black Maria. With 1,093 US patents in his name, as well
        as patents in other countries, Edison is regarded as the most prolific
        inventor in American history. Edison married twice and fathered six
        children. He died in 1931 due to complications from diabetes.

      <h3>Early life</h3>
      <p>
        Thomas Edison was born in 1847 in Milan, Ohio, but grew up in Port
        Huron, Michigan, after the family moved there in 1854. He was the
        seventh and last child of Samuel Ogden Edison Jr. (1804–1896, born in
        Marshalltown, Nova Scotia) and Nancy Matthews Elliott (1810–1871, born
        in Chenango County, New York). His patrilineal family line was Dutch by
        way of New Jersey; the surname had originally been "Edeson". Edison was
        taught reading, writing, and arithmetic by his mother, who used to be a
        school teacher. He attended school for only a few months. However, one
        biographer described him as a very curious child who learned most things
        by reading on his own. As a child, he became fascinated with technology
        and spent hours working on experiments at home. Thomas Edison began his
        career as a news butcher, selling newspapers, candy, and vegetables on
        trains running from Port Huron to Detroit. He turned a $50-a-week profit
        by age 13, most of which went to buying equipment for electrical and
        chemical experiments. At age 15, in 1862, he saved 3-year-old Jimmie
        MacKenzie from being struck by a runaway train. Jimmie's father, station
        agent J. U. MacKenzie of Mount Clemens, Michigan, was so grateful that
        he trained Edison as a telegraph operator In 1866, at the age of 19,
        Edison moved to Louisville, Kentucky, where, as an employee of Western
        Union, he worked the Associated Press bureau news wire. Edison requested
        the night shift, which allowed him plenty of time to spend at his two
        favorite pastimes—reading and experimenting. Eventually, the latter
        pre-occupation cost him his job. One night in 1867, he was working with
        a lead–acid battery when he spilt sulfuric acid onto the floor. It ran
        between the floorboards and onto his boss's desk below. The next morning
        Edison was fired.

      <h3>Final days</h3>
      <p>
        Henry Ford, the automobile magnate, later lived a few hundred feet away
        from Edison at his winter retreat in Fort Myers. Ford once worked as an
        engineer for the Edison Illuminating Company of Detroit and met Edison
        at a convention of affiliated Edison Illuminating companies in Brooklyn,
        NY in 1896. Edison was impressed with Ford's internal combustion engine
        automobile and encouraged its developments. They were friends until
        Edison's death. Edison and Ford undertook annual motor camping trips
        from 1914 to 1924. Harvey Firestone and naturalist John Burroughs also
        participated. In 1928, Edison joined the Fort Myers Civitan Club. He
        believed strongly in the organization, writing that "The Civitan Club is
        doing things—big things—for the community, state, and nation, and I
        certainly consider it an honor to be numbered in its ranks." He was
        an active member in the club until his death, sometimes bringing Henry
        Ford to the club's meetings.Edison was said to have been influenced by a
        popular fad diet in his last few years; "the only liquid he consumed was
        a pint of milk every three hours". He is reported to have believed
        this diet would restore his health. However, this tale is doubtful. In
        1930, the year before Edison died, Mina said in an interview about him,
        "Correct eating is one of his greatest hobbies." She also said that
        during one of his periodic "great scientific adventures", Edison would
        be up at 7:00, have breakfast at 8:00, and be rarely home for lunch or
        dinner, implying that he continued to have all three. Edison became
        the owner of his Milan, Ohio, birthplace in 1906. On his last visit, in
        1923, he was reportedly shocked to find his old home still lit by lamps
        and candles.
        <h2>Death</h2>
        Edison died of complications of diabetes on October 18, 1931, in his home,
         "Glenmont" in Llewellyn Park in West Orange, New Jersey, which he had
          purchased in 1886 as a wedding gift for Mina. Rev. Stephen J. Herben 
          officiated at the funeral; Edison is buried behind the home.
          Edison's last breath is reportedly contained in a test tube at The Henry 
          Ford museum near Detroit. Ford reportedly convinced Charles Edison to seal
           a test tube of air in the inventor's room shortly after his death, as a
            memento. A plaster death mask and casts of Edison's hands were also
             made. Mina died in 1947.
