      <h3>Brahma Gupta</h3>
      <p>
        Brahmagupta (c. 598 c .668 CE) was an Indian mathematician and
        astronomer. He is the author of two early works on mathematics and
        astronomy: the Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (BSS, "correctly established
        doctrine of Brahma", dated 628), a theoretical treatise, and the
        Khaṇḍakhādyaka ("edible bite", dated 665), a more practical text.In 628
        CE, Brahmagupta first described gravity as an attractive force, and used
        the term "gurutvākarṣaṇam (गुरुत्वाकर्षणम्)" in Sanskrit to describe it.
        Brahmagupta is credited with first clear description of the quadratic
        formula (the solution of the quadratic equation) in his main work, the
        Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta.

      <h3>Birth to Death</h3>
      <p>
        According to his statements in some received sources, Brahmagupta was
        born in 598 CE. He resided in Bhillamala, presently Bhinmal, in
        Rajasthan, although during reign of the Chavda dynasty ruler,
        Vyagrahamukha. He was always focused to work finding new concepts.
        Later, commentators referred to him as a Bhillamalacharya or the
        instructor from Bhillamala. Bhillamala was the capital of the
        Gurjaradesa, West India's second-biggest state, which comprised
        contemporary India 's south side Rajasthan & north side Gujarat. It was
        also a centre of study institutions for mathematics and astronomy.
        Brahmagupta studied the five classic Siddhantas of Indian astronomy but
        also the learning of many other astronomers, including Aryabhata I,
        Latadeva, Pradyumna, Varahamihira, Simha, Srisena, Vijayanandin, and
        Vishnuchandra. Somewhere at the age of 30, he authored and introduced
        the book named Brahmasphutasiddhanta, which itself is regarded to be a
        revised version of the recognised Siddhanta of the Brahmapaksha
        institution of astronomy.

      <h3>Creating Zero</h3>
      <p>
        When Brahmagupta attempted to divide 0 by 0, he came to the result of 0.
        However, most modern mathematicians would argue that 0 divided by 0 is
        undefined, or an “indeterminate form”. Despite this outlier, the rest of
        Brahmagupta’s grasp on the number zero is exactly how we conceptualize
        it today. The concept of zero gradually moved East into China. Then West
        to reach the Middle East. And finally, over half a century from its
        conception, the zero made it to Europe, where its importance was finally
        recognised by the Western culture that previously frowned on the idea of
        nothing, referring to it as meaningless or even satanic. In 1200 AD,
        Italian mathematician Fibonacci, a man who has been considered the ‘most
        talented western mathematician of the middle ages’ wrote of Indian
        Mathematics and their use of zero: Despite the number zero having quite
        literally no value, its concept has allowed mathematics to develop into
        what it is today. Its curation led to the three pillars of modern
        mathematics: algebra, algorithms, and calculus. The use of calculus (the
        mathematical study of continuous change), which the zero is crucial for,
        has allowed engineering and modern technology to be possible. The use of
        zero and one within the binary system is what made computing possible.
        So, without the invention of zero much of what we know today would not
        have been possible. The device you are reading this on would not have
        been able to be invented, if not for Aryabhata, Brahmagupta and India’s
        fascination with the idea of nothing.
